Like network TV, streamed content may be regularly scheduled, or like Netflix and Hulu, content may be streamed on demand. It refers to any media content  live or recorded that is delivered to computers and mobile devices via the internet and played back in real time with different genres and contents for each viewer. Often can be watched thru different websites (twitch, YouTube, FB gaming and more)
